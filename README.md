# Description
The project KeyMouseMover is a simple C++ program that lets the user control the mouse pointer with the keyboard. It uses a custom `timeManager` singleton class to measure the time between frames, so movement can be adjusted based on real elapsed time. In the main loop, the program checks which keys are pressed: the arrow keys move the mouse cursor up, down, left, or right, while the Enter key simulates a left mouse click by sending input events. The `processFrame` function handles all the key detection and cursor updates, while the `timeManager` ensures smooth timing by calculating how long each frame takes. Essentially, the program turns the keyboard into a basic mouse controller. This is only a learning project I made out of boredom, and while this functionality probably already exists natively in the system, I am not aware of it.
